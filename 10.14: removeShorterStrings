/**
* Write a method removeShorterStrings that takes an ArrayList of Strings as a parameter and that removes from each successive pair of values
* the shorter string in the pair. For example, suppose that an ArrayList called list contains the following values:
* {"four", "score", "and", "seven", "years", "ago"} In the first pair, "four" and "score", the shorter string is "four". 
* In the second pair, "and" and "seven", the shorter string is "and". In the third pair, "years" and "ago", the shorter string is "ago".
* Therefore, the call: removeShorterStrings(list); should remove these shorter strings, leaving the list as follows:
* "score", "seven", "years". If there is a tie (both strings have the same length), your method should remove the first string in the pair.
* If there is an odd number of strings in the list, the final value should be kept in the list.
